This repo contains mostly Python code. While it started out as a library to be used at the command-line or in a REPL, it now includes a graphical user interface.

Some of the heavy computational work is done by forking out to Stanford's CoreNLP suite, written in Java.

The GUI is written using the Tkinter module, a set of bindings for the Tk graphical toolkit.

In the orientation folder, you can find a sample dataset and an iPython notebook for getting started. The library source code is in the corpkit folder. And there's some slides and TeX source in the talks folder.
